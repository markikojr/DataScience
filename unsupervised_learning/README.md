# Unsupervised (Machine Learning)

## Description: 
Projects to show how Unsupervised Models are built.

## Prerequisites:
- You must have python3 (Scikit Learn and Pandas).
- Clone this repository to your computer.
- Access files .py inside folders.
- Make sure to check the correct path to access the data for each program if required.

## Projects:

### KMeans for Clustering: [KMeans.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/unsupervised_learning/KMeans.py)  
This contains code for clustering using KMeans model to cluster fake income/age for N people.

### K-Nearest Neighbors: [KNN.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/unsupervised_learning/KNN.py)  
This code uses KNN model to define some distance metric between the items in your dataset, and find the K closest items.

### Principal Component Analysis: [PCA.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/unsupervised_learning/PCA.py) 
This contains code for classification using PCA model to predict Flowers species from the Iris Flowers dataset and make dimension reduction.

### Support Vector Machines: [SVM.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/unsupervised_learning/SVM.py) 
This contains code for classification using SVM model to cluster fake income/age for N people in different color regions.

## Running the project
1) Open terminal execute `python name.py`
