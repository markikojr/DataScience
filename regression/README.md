# Regression (Machine Learning)

## Description: 
Projects to show how Regression Models are built.

## Prerequisites:
- You must have python3 (Scikit Learn and Pandas).
- Clone this repository to your computer.
- Access files .py inside folders.
- Make sure to check the correct path to access the data for each program if required.

## Projects:

### Linear Regression: [LinearRegression.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/regression/LinearRegression.py)  
This contains code for Linear Regression model to predict data points for a website page speed and amount purchased in a linear relation.

### Polynomial Regression: [PolynomialRegression.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/regression/PolynomialRegression.py)  
This contains code for Polynomial Regression model to predict data points for a website page speed and amount purchased in a non-linear relation.

### Multivariate Regression: [MultivariateRegression.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/regression/MultivariateRegression.py) 
This contains code for Multivariate Regression to the price of cars based on their features.

### Train and Test: [SVM.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/regression/TrainTest.py) 
This contains code for Polynomial Regression model to predict data points for a website page speed and amount purchased in a non-linear relation making a comparison 
between train and test data.

## Running the project
1) Open terminal execute `python name.py`
