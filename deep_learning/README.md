# Deep Learning

## Description: 
projects to show how Deep Learning Models are built.

## Prerequisites:
- You must have python3 (Scikit Learn, Pandas, tensorflow and keras).
- Clone this repository to your computer.
- Access files .py inside folders.
- Make sure to check the correct path to access the data for each program if required.

## Projects:

### Neural Network with tensorflow: [TensorFlow.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/deep_learning/TensorFlow.py)  
This contains code for our Neural Network model using tensorflow to predict numbers from 0-9 on the MNIST data set (image recognition).

### Neural Network with keras: [Keras.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/deep_learning/Keras.py)  
This contains code for our Neural Network model using keras to predict numbers from 0-9 on the MNIST data set (image recognition).

### Convolutional Neural Network: [CNN.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/deep_learning/CNN.py) 
This contains code for our Convolutional Neural Network model using keras to predict numbers from 0-9 on the MNIST data set (image recognition).

### Recurring Neural Network: [RNN.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/deep_learning/RNN.py) 
This contains code for our Recurring Neural Network model to classifier movie reviews (sentiment analysis).

### Neural Network with keras (mammogram): [mammogram.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/deep_learning/mammogram.py)  
This contains code for our Neural Network model using keras to train it to classify masses as benign or malignant based on its features.
