#  Python For Finance: Algorithmic Trading

## Description: 
Projects to show how to analyse and build models applied to Finance.

## Prerequisites:
- You must have python3 (Scikit Learn, Numpy, pickle, Matplotlib, Counter, datetime, yfinance, pandas_datareader and Pandas).
- Clone this repository to your computer.
- Access files .py inside folders.
- Make sure to check the correct path to access the data for each program if required.

## Projects:

### Stock Data Analysis: [StockDataAnalysis.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/StockDataAnalysis.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using a combination of multiple tools to analyse stocks, such as checking Open, High, Close, Low and Adj. values, comparisons between companies, moving average comparisons, metrics calculations, returns, Regime and signal defitions using moving average crossover, portifolio test and backtest.

### Portfolio: [Portfolio.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/Portfolio.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using signal defition from moving average crossover to build a portfolio test.

### Moving Average Crossover: [MovingAverageCrossOver.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/MovingAverageCrossOver.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using signal defition from moving average crossover.

### Buy, Sell or Hold classifier using Machine Learning: [ProcessingDataMachineLearning.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/ProcessingDataMachineLearning.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using Machine Learning algorithms to create a classifier to decide whether to buy, sell or hold a stock..

### Comparison between companies: [ComparingCompanies.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/ComparingCompanies.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using pandas and matplotlib to make comparisons between companies showing some important analysis such as Returns, Moving Average and Volatility.

### Companies correlation: [CompaniesCorr.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/CompaniesCorr.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using pandas and matplotlib to calculate correlation between companies.

### Stock Price Returns: [Returns.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/Returns.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using pandas and matplotlib to calculate stock price returns.

### Moving Average: [MovingAverage.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/MovingAverage.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using pandas to calculate moving average.

### Resample: [Resample.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/Resample.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using pandas to resample the data.

### Data Cleaning: [DataCleaning.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/DataCleaning.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using pandas to process data detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting.

### SP500 Data from Web: [SP500Data.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/SP500Data.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using pandas to load SP500 data from web.

### Data from Web: [DataFromWeb.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/DataFromWeb.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using pandas to load .csv files from web.

### Data from CSV: [DataFromCSV.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/finance/DataFromCSV.py)  
This contains code for Python Finance using pandas to load .csv files.


## Running the project
1) Open terminal execute `python name.py`

## Observations:

### Open: 
The price of the stock at the beginning of the trading day (it need not be the closing price of the previous trading day).

### High:
The highest price of the stock on that trading day. 

### Low: 
the lowest price of the stock on that trading day. 

### Close:
The price of the stock at closing time. 

### Volume:
Indicates how many stocks were traded.

### Adjusted prices: 
The price of the stock that adjusts the price for corporate actions. While stock prices are considered to be set mostly by traders, stock splits (when the company makes each extant stock worth two and halves the price) and dividends (payout of company profits per share) also affect the price of a stock and should be accounted for.
