# Classification (Machine Learning)

## Description: 
Projects to show how Classification Models are built.

## Prerequisites:
- You must have python3 (Scikit Learn and Pandas).
- Clone this repository to your computer.
- Access files .py inside folders.
- Make sure to check the correct path to access the data for each program if required.

## Projects:

### Decision Tree and Random Forest for classification: [DecisionTree.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/classification/DecisionTree.py)  
This contains code for classification using model to predict employment of specific candidate profiles from the dataset PastHires.csv.

### Naive Bayes for classification: [NaiveBayes.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/classification/NaiveBayes.py)  
This contains code for classification using model to predict whether an email is spam or ham. It uses datasets inside emails folder to build the model.

### Comparison between models: [ModelComparison.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/classification/ModelComparison.py) 
This contains code for classification using models to predict Flowers species from the Iris Flowers dataset and make model comparisons.

### Support Vector Machines for classification: [KFoldCrossValidation.py](https://github.com/markikojr/DataScience/blob/master/classification/KFoldCrossValidation.py) 
This contains code for classification using model to predict Flowers species from the Iris Flowers dataset. It uses KFold Cross Validation to improve results avoiding overfitting.

## Running the project
1) Open terminal execute `python name.py`
