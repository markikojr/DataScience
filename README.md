# Data Science Portfolio

## Description: Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Python.
Directory contains folders with runnable sample python programs for machine learning.

## To run:
- First install python3 and libraries. Install the requirements for your project using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
- Clone this repository to your computer
- Access files .py inside folders
- Make sure to check the correct path to access the data for each program.
- From the command line, execute: `python example.py`, replacing "example.py" with the name of a program.
